---

**Quick Answer:** Set up your site identity with `defineOrganization()` or `definePerson()`. This establishes who owns/creates your content and enables Google Knowledge Panel eligibility.

## Why does Schema.org identity matter for SEO?

Providing an identity allows Google to display a prominent Knowledge Panel with details of the identity. It also connects all your content to a single entity, improving E-E-A-T signals.

## Which identity type should I choose?

Choose based on what your site represents. If unsure, select `Organization`.

### When should I use Organization?

Use Organization for companies, brands, or any non-personal entity. It's the most common choice.

- Doesn't need to relate to an official business
- Use for eCommerce without a physical location

Example: [nuxtjs.org](https://nuxtjs.org), [vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org)

```ts
import { defineOrganization, defineWebPage, defineWebSite, useSchemaOrg } from '@unhead/schema-org/@framework'

useSchemaOrg([
  defineOrganization({
    name: 'My company',
    logo: '/logo.png',
    sameAs: [
      'https://twitter.com/company'
    ]
  }),
  defineWebSite({/* ... */}),
  defineWebPage(),
])
```

### When should I use Person?

Use Person when your website represents an individual, personal brand, or personal blog.

Example: [harlanzw.com](https://harlanzw.com), [antfu.me](https://antfu.me)

```ts
import { definePerson, defineWebPage, defineWebSite, useSchemaOrg } from '@unhead/schema-org/@framework'

useSchemaOrg([
  definePerson({
    name: 'Harlan Wilton',
    image: '/me.png',
    sameAs: [
      'https://github.com/harlan-zw',
    ]
  }),
  defineWebSite({/* ... */}),
  defineWebPage(),
])
```

### When should I use Local Business?

Use LocalBusiness when your website represents a physical business with an address.

- Extends [Organization](/docs/schema-org/api/schema/organization)
- Use for eCommerce with a physical location

Example: [onacoffee.com.au](https://onacoffee.com.au), [intracbr.com.au](https://intracbr.com.au)

```ts
import { defineLocalBusiness, defineWebPage, defineWebSite, useSchemaOrg } from '@unhead/schema-org/@framework'

useSchemaOrg([
  defineLocalBusiness({
    name: 'Harlan\'s Hamburgers',
    address: {
      streetAddress: '123 Main St',
      addressLocality: 'Harlan',
      addressRegion: 'MA',
      postalCode: '01234',
      addressCountry: 'US',
    },
    image: 'https://emojiguide.org/images/emoji/n/3ep4zx1jztp0n.png',
  }),
  defineWebSite({/* ... */}),
  defineWebPage(),
])
```

## How does identity connect to other Schema.org nodes?

Once set, your identity automatically populates these relationships:

| Node | Property |
|------|----------|
| [Article](/docs/schema-org/api/schema/article) | `publisher`, `author` |
| [Product](/docs/schema-org/api/schema/product) | `brand` |
| [WebSite](/docs/schema-org/api/schema/website) | `publisher` |
| [WebPage](/docs/schema-org/api/schema/webpage) | `about` (home page only) |
