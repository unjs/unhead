## Background

With Unhead Schema.org you can inject a Schema.org graph into your page.

Wrapper functions have been added to make opting in to [Google Rich Results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/head/guides/core-concepts/search-gallery)
nodes easier.

For officially supported nodes, when the graph is being resolved it will apply a number of transforms to ensure the
data is valid for Google.

Otherwise, you can provide your own custom nodes that are passed through as is.

## Site / Page Level Config

When resolving the graph, the package will inject config from the site and page level to reduce the amount of boilerplate.

For example, if you have a `<title>`{lang="html"}  on your page, then it's likely we can use this same title to generate the Schema.org WebPage's `name`.

The following inferences are from your `<head>`{lang="html"}  data:

- `inLanguage` - `<html lang="en">`{lang="html"}  (`en`)
- `name` - `<title>test</title>`{lang="html"}  (`test`)
- `description` - `<meta name="description" content="test">`{lang="html"}  (`test`)
- `url` - `<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/my-page">`{lang="html"}  (`https://example.com`)
- `image` - `<meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/image.jpg">`{lang="html"}  (`https://example.com/image.jpg`)

Otherwise, they will come from your [Schema.org Params](/schema-org/getting-started/params).

## Deduping Nodes

For certain nodes, only one of them can exist at once. For example, a page can only have one `WebPage` node.

When resolving the graph, the package will dedupe nodes based on the `@id` of the node.

## Transformers

There's numerous resolvers available to help minimise the work in maintaining and developing Schema.

### URL Transformer

Any URL field allows a relevant link to be provided.
This link will either be prefixed with the canonical host or the canonical page URL.

```ts
import { defineComment } from '@unhead/schema-org/@framework'

defineComment({
  text: 'This is really cool!',
  author: {
    name: 'Harlan Wilton',
    url: '/user/harlan-wilton',
  }
})
```

```json
[
  {
    "@id": "https://example.com/#/schema/person/1230192103",
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Harlan Wilton",
    "url": "https://example.com/user/harlan-wilton"
  },
  {
    "@id": "https://example.com/#/schema/comment/2288441280",
    "@type": "Comment",
    "author": {
      "@id": "https://example.com/#/schema/person/1230192103"
    },
    "text": "This is really cool!"
  }
]
```

### Image Transformer

Uses the same relative link logic as the URL transformer.

Additionally, single string images will be transformed to an [ImageObject](https://schema.org/ImageObject) and added as a root node and an
applicable link to the `@id` will be added.

```ts
import { defineWebPage } from '@unhead/schema-org/@framework'

defineWebPage({
  image: '/my-image.png',
})
```

```json
{
  "@id": "https://example.com/#/schema/image/1571960974",
  "@type": "ImageObject",
  "contentUrl": "https://example.com//my-image.png",
  "url": "https://example.com//my-image.png"
}
```

### ID Transformer

Providing an `@id` for a Schema node is sometimes useful to setup your own relations. When configuring the `@id` you can
provide it as a simple string beginning with `#`.

The ID will be resolved to use the canonical host or the canonical page path as a prefix.

```ts
import { defineBreadcrumb } from '@unhead/schema-org/@framework'

defineBreadcrumb({
  '@id': '#subbreadcrumb',
  'itemListElement': [
    { name: 'Sub breadcrumb link', item: '/blog/test' },
  ],
})
```

```json
{
  "@id": "https://example.com/#subbreadcrumb",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList"
}
```

### Type Transformer

Providing a string of `@type` will be augmented with the default type. This is to allow fallbacks when the specific `@type`
is not supported by Google.

```ts
import { defineWebPage } from '@unhead/schema-org/@framework'

defineWebPage({
  '@type': 'FAQPage',
})
```

```json
{
  "@type": [
    "WebPage",
    "FAQPage"
  ]
}
```

### Date Transformer

Any date can be provided as a string or a js `Date` object. When a `Date` object is provided it will be transformed to the
[ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.

```ts
import { defineWebPage } from '@unhead/schema-org/@framework'

defineWebPage({
  datePublished: new Date(2022, 1, 10, 0, 0, 0),
})
```

```json
{
  "datePublished": "2022-01-10T00:00:0+00:00"
}
```

## Third Party Validators

To confirm the schema generated is valid, you should run it through both <https://validator.schema.org/> and <https://search.google.com/test/rich-results>.
