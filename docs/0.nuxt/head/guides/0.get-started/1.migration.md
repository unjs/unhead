## Introduction

As of Nuxt 3.16, Unhead v2 is the default version for Nuxt.

While this change was made without breaking changes, if you've opted into the Nuxt v4 mode, you may have run into some issues.

### Nuxt v4 Migration

The best resource for managing the migration is the official [Nuxt v4 migration guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/upgrade#migrating-to-nuxt-4).
