**Quick Start:** Unhead is built into Nuxt 3 - just use `useHead()`, `useSeoMeta()`, or `useScript()` directly in your components. No installation needed!

## Do I need to install Unhead in Nuxt?

No. Unhead has first-class support for Nuxt and is integrated out-of-the-box. Much of the work gone into Unhead is a direct result of feedback from the Nuxt community.

Nuxt is integrated out-of-the-box with Unhead so no installation is required.
