## Introduction

Unhead is designed for full-stack usage, running efficiently on both server and client environments.

When optimizing your application bundle size, you may want to conditionally render certain tags only on the client or only on the server. This guide explains how to implement these optimizations.

## Client-Only Tags

Client-only tags are rendered exclusively in the browser, reducing your server-side bundle size.

### Use Cases

- Analytics scripts (Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.)
- User tracking and personalization scripts
- Client-side feature detection
- Progressive enhancement

### Implementation

Use environment conditionals to specify client-only tags:

```ts
import { useHead } from '@unhead/dynamic-import'

// Using import.meta environment variables
if (import.meta.client) {
  useHead({
    script: [
      {
        src: 'https://example.com/analytics.js',
        defer: true
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

## Server-Only Tags

Server-only tags are only rendered during server-side rendering, reducing your client-side bundle size.

### Use Cases

- SEO metadata that doesn't need client reactivity
- Open Graph images and social media metadata
- Static metadata that appears on every page
- Schema.org structured data

### Implementation

```ts
import { useHead } from '@unhead/dynamic-import'

if (import.meta.server) {
  useHead({
    meta: [
      {
        property: 'og:image',
        content: 'https://example.com/my-image.jpg'
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

## Common Use Cases

### Analytics After Hydration

Load analytics only after the application has hydrated:

```ts
import { useHead } from '@unhead/dynamic-import'

if (import.meta.client) {
  useHead({
    script: [
      {
        src: 'https://example.com/analytics.js',
        defer: true,
        async: true
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

### Static SEO Tags on Server

Add SEO metadata that doesn't need client updates:

```ts
import { useHead } from '@unhead/dynamic-import'

if (import.meta.server) {
  useHead({
    meta: [
      { name: 'robots', content: 'index, follow' },
      { name: 'description', content: 'Site description' }
    ]
  })
}
```

## Caveats

::warning
Some tags have dependencies that span client and server rendering:
- `titleTemplate` affects `title` rendering - include on both client and server to avoid title flashing
- Tags with `tagPosition` or `tagPriority`{lang="ts"} may behave differently if not consistently applied
- Event handlers are only triggered in their respective environments
::

When using environment-specific tags, ensure any dependent tags are included in both environments when needed.
