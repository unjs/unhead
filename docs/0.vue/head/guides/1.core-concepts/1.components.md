**Quick Answer:** Use `<Head>`, `<Title>`, `<Meta>`, `<Link>`, and `<Script>` components for template-based head management. Import from `@unhead/vue/components`.

## What is the Head component?

The Unhead Vue package exports a `<Head>`{lang="html"} component that can be used to manage your head tags.

While it's recommended to use the `useHead()`{lang="ts"} composable as it offers a more flexible API with full TypeScript support,
the `<Head>`{lang="html"} component may make more sense for your project.

## How do I use the Head component?

The component takes any child elements that you would normally put in your actual `<head>`{lang="html"} and renders them
with Unhead.

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { Head } from '@unhead/vue/components'
</script>

<template>
  <Head>
    <title>My awesome site</title>
    <meta name="description" content="My awesome site description">
  </Head>
</template>
```

When the head component is unmounted, it will remove all the tags that were added.
