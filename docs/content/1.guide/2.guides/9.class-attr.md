# Class Attribute

When using the `htmlAttrs` or `bodyAttrs` options, you can use the `class` attribute to add classes to the `html` or `body` elements.

```ts
useHead({
  htmlAttrs: {
    class: 'my-class',
  }
})
```

For improved reactivity and merging support, you can provide the class as an object or an array.

## Class Object

When providing class as an object, the key should be the class and the value will be whether the class should be added or not.

```ts
const darkMode = false

useHead({
  htmlAttrs: {
    class: {
      // will be rendered
      dark: darkMode,
      // will not be rendered
      light: !darkMode,
    }
  }
})
```

## Class Array

```ts
useHead([
  htmlAttrs: {
    class: ['my-class', 'my-other-class'],
  }
])
