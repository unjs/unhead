# Setup

Using Vue? Check out the [Vue integration](/integrations/vue/setup) for computed getter and ref support.

## Install

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn add unhead
```

```bash [npm]
npm install unhead
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add unhead
```

::

If your app has SSR, you may also want the SSR package:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @unhead/ssr
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @unhead/ssr
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @unhead/ssr
```

::

## Setup

### 1. Create your head

Start by creating a head instance somewhere in your apps entry.

```ts [main.ts]
import { createHead } from 'unhead'

// Create a global head instance
const head = createHead()
```

### 2. Use the `useHead` composable

Test it's working by adding `useHead` somewhere in your application.

```ts
import { useHead } from 'unhead'

useHead({
  title: 'My awesome site'
})
```

### Next Steps

Your app is now setup for head management, congrats! 🎉
